# List of “Frequently Encountered Words”

From [ShakespearesWords.com](https://www.shakespeareswords.com/Public/LanguageCompanion/Few.aspx):

> Several of the content-carrying words in Shakespeare are used so often that we find it helpful to approach them in the manner of a language-teaching phrase-book, singling them out so that readers can more easily develop an intuition about how they are used. We have selected 100 of these words, in particular senses, in the list below, and chosen quotations for them which illustrate several grammatical contexts. We like to think of these words as a preliminary word-list which captures some of the character of basic Early Modern English vocabulary.
