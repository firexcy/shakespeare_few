### [[The Comedy of Errors]] [CE IV.i.25](https://www.shakespeareswords.com/Public/Play.aspx?Act=4&Scene=1&WorkId=1#113587) 

**Antipholus of Ephesus to Angelo** *==Belike== you thought our love would last too long / If it were chained together, and therefore came not.*

**以弗所的安提福勒斯** 您是认为咱们的友情一旦让链子锁住，/ 会再也拆不开，所以就不来了？

### [Ham III.ii.302](https://www.shakespeareswords.com/Public/Play.aspx?Act=3&Scene=2&WorkId=2#117731) 

**Hamlet to Horatio, of Claudius and the play** *For if the King like not the comedy, Why then, ==belike== he likes it not, perdy.*

**哈姆莱特** 王上若是对这出喜剧不喜欢，/ 那么，他==多半就==真是不喜欢。

(perdie, perdy (int.): \[French 'par Dieu'\] by God)
