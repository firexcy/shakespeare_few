Modern usage

a mood or state of mind

- *archaic* an inclination or whim

ORIGIN Middle English: via Old French from Latin *humor* ‘moisture’, from *humere* ‘be moist’. The original sense was ‘bodily fluid’ (surviving in *aqueous humour* and *vitreous humour*); it was used specifically for any of the cardinal humors, whence ‘mental disposition’ (thought to be caused by the relative proportions of the humors). This led, in the 16th century, to the senses ‘mood’ and ‘whim’, hence to *humour* someone ‘to indulge a person's whim’. humor dates from the late 16th century.
