Modern usage 

a man whose wife is sexually unfaithful, regarded as an object of derision

ORIGIN late Old English, from Old French *cucuault*, from *cucu* ‘cuckoo’ (from the cuckoo's habit of laying its egg in another bird's nest). The equivalent words in French and other languages applied to both the bird and the adulterer; cuckold has never been applied to the bird in English.
