From OED

indeed (often used ironically or to express surprise or indignation)

ORIGIN Old English *forsōth* 

(see 

- for (Old English, probably a reduction of a Germanic preposition meaning ‘before’ (in place or time); related to German *für*, also to *fore*
    - Old English (as a preposition, also in the sense ‘before in time, previously’): of Germanic origin; related to Dutch *voor* and German *vor*. The adjective and noun represent the prefix *fore-* used independently (late 15th century)
