Modern usage

feeling or showing sorrow; unhappy

- causing or characterized by sorrow or regret; unfortunate and regrettable

ORIGIN Old English *sæd* ‘sated, weary’, also ‘weighty, dense’, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch *zat* and German *satt*, from an Indo-European root shared by Latin *satis* ‘enough’. The original meaning was replaced in Middle English by the senses ‘steadfast, firm’ and ‘serious, sober’, and later ‘sorrowful’.
