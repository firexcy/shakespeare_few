From OED

1 at the present time; now

2 after a short time; soon

USAGE In the pain will lessen presently, the meaning of presently is ‘soon.’ In limited resources are presently available, the meaning is ‘at this moment, now.’ **Both senses date back to the Middle Ages, but the second sense fell into disfavor between the 17th and 20th centuries.** Although some traditionalists still object to it, the ’now‘ sense is widely used and generally regarded as acceptable standard English.
