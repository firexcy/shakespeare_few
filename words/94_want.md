Modern usage

*\[no object\]* *literary* lack or be short of something desirable or essential

- \[with object\] *archaic* (chiefly used in expressions of time) be short of or lack (a specified amount or thing)

ORIGIN Middle English: the noun from Old Norse *vant*, neuter of *vanr* ‘lacking’; the verb from Old Norse *vanta* ‘be lacking’. The original notion of ‘lack’ was early extended to ‘need’ and from this developed the sense ‘desire’.
